## Common Questions

### Q: Where did the Account button go?
**A:** We replaced it with the universal hamburger menu (☰) for a more consistent experience across all devices. The menu now contains everything that was in the Account button, plus more!

### Q: Why is the menu always visible, even on desktop?
**A:** For consistency! Now you have the same navigation experience whether you're on your phone, tablet, or computer. No more hunting for different buttons on different devices.

### Q: Can I still see my navigation links on desktop?
**A:** Yes! On desktop, you'll see your main navigation links in the center of the header (like "Request Cash", "My Orders", etc.). The hamburger menu provides additional options like Profile and Logout.

### Q: What if I have multiple roles?
**A:** No problem! The menu will show sections for each of your roles. For example, if you're both an Admin and a Runner, you'll see both the Admin section and the Runner section in your menu.

### Q: Is the menu accessible for keyboard users?
**A:** Absolutely! You can:
- Press **Tab** to navigate through menu items
