# Fonts Directory

Place `ibrand.otf` in this directory.

The font should be:
- Valid OTF format
- Named exactly: `ibrand.otf`
- Accessible at: `/fonts/ibrand.otf`

If you're getting an OTS parsing error, verify the font file is valid:
1. Open in Font Book (macOS) or similar font viewer
2. If it fails to open, re-export from the original source
3. Ensure it's exported as OTF (OpenType Font) format
